## About R script

File with R code "run_analysis.R" perform 5 following steps:

Merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
- Reading files

Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement
- Reading column names
- Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
- Making nessesary subset from setAllInOne

Using descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names

Creating a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject
- Making second tidy data set
- Writing second tidy data set in txt file


## About variables

x_train, y_train, x_test, y_test, subject_train and subject_test contain the data from the downloaded files.
x_data, y_data and subject_data merge the previous datasets to further analysis.
features contains the correct names for the x_data dataset, which are applied to the column names stored in
